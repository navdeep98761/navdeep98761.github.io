<p>A machine is a device that uses energy to perform a specific task or function. Machines can be simple, such as a lever, a pulley, or a wheel, or complex, such as a computer, a car, or a robot. 
Machines can help humans do work faster, easier, or more efficiently. Here is an example of  a machine:</p>

 <p>A computer is a machine that can process information and perform various tasks. A computer consists of hardware and software components that work together to execute instructions.
 The hardware components include  the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, the input and output devices, and the storage devices. The software components include the operating system, the applications, and the data. 
 A computer can communicate with other computers through networks, such as the Internet. Computers can be used for various purposes, such as education, entertainment, business, and research
</p>
<P>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.
 Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. 
 A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. 
 This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included,
 as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.
